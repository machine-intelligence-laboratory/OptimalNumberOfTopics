# Demos

Here go notebooks with experiments when different search methods are applied to find an optimal number of topics in different datasets.

## Data

Some datasets used in demo notebooks are actually available for download using [TopicNet library](https://github.com/machine-intelligence-laboratory/TopicNet).
If a dataset from demo notebooks can't yet be downloaded like 
```python
topicnet.dataset_manager.load_dataset(dataset_name)
```
but you want to reproduce the experiments, you may contact the contributors and they will provide the data.
